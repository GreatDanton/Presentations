# Basic commands



## man

Manual pages - built in documentation

```bash
# usage
man [command]

man man
man ls
man firefox
```

## ls

List directory contents
```bash
# usage
ls -[options]

ls
ls -a     # display hidden files
ls -la    # display hidden files in long format
ls -la -r # display all in reverse order
ls -la -h # display file sizes in human readable format
```

* hidden files: dotfiles [.filename]
* file extensions:  no file extensions, everything in Linux is file
* naming files: use [file_name], [fileName], [file-name] instead of spaces



## Pwd
Print working directory

```bash
pwd
```


## Shebang line

Shebang line is used to tell the system the name of the interpreter
that should be used to execute the script

```
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
```

## cd
Change directory

```bash
# usage
cd [path]

cd        # change to home folder
cd -      # change to previous working directory
cd ..     # change to parent folder
```


```bash
# Tips

/var/log  # absolute path - begins with root directory
var/log   # relative path - begins with current working directory

.         # working directory
..        # working directory parent directory

(TAB)     # autocomplete
(TAB,TAB) # show all possibilities
(Select,middle mouse button)  # copy & paste
```


## cat
Concatenate files and print on standard input

```bash
# usage
cat [file1] [file2] [file3] ...

# print from bottom to top
tac [file1] [file2] [file3] ...
```

## tail
Display last n lines
```bash
# usage
tail -n 5 [file]    # display last 5 lines of file
```


## head
Display first n lines

```bash
# usage
head -n 3 [file]   # display first 3 lines of file
```


# Manipulating files and directories


## touch
Create new empty file
```bash
touch [filename]
```

## mkdir
Create new empty folder
```bash
mkdir [directory]
mkdir [dir2] [dir2] [dir3]
```


## cp
Copy files

```bash
# usage
cp [/path/to/input] [/path/to/output]

cp [file1] [file2] [dir]
cp -r [dir1] [dir2]     # copy recursively (when copying directories)
cp -u [input] [output]  # copy only files that do not exist or are newer
```


## mv
Move or rename files

```bash
# usage
mv [path/to/input] [path/to/output_folder]

# rename file
mv ~/Documents/file123 ~/Documents/file
```



\pagebreak


## rm
Remove files or folders

**THIS IS DANGEROUS COMMAND, BE CAREFUL!**

```bash
# Be careful when using these
rm [file]         # remove file
rm -r [folder]    # remove folder recursively
rm -rf [folder]   # remove folder recursively, and do not prompt

rm -r -i [folder] # prompt before every removal
rm -r -I [folder] # prompt once
```




# Intermediate commands

## Wildcards

Select filenames based on patterns

```bash
*         # Any characters
?         # Any single character
[:alnum:] # Any alphanumeric character
[:alpha:] # Any alphabetic character
[:digit:] # Any digit
[:lower:] # Any lowercase letter

          # There are more but we are ending here
```

```bash
# Examples:
a*            # show everything that starts with a
*.txt         # show everything that ends with .txt
a*.txt        # Any file beginning with 'a' and ending with .txt
ab??def       # File: ab + "any 2 characters" + def
[[:digit:]]*  # Any file starting with digit
[![:lower:]]* # Any file not starting with lowercase
```



## Grep
Print lines matching a pattern (filter)

```bash
grep [text]
grep -v [text] # display lines not containing [text]
egrep [text + wildcards]
```

\pagebreak

## Pipe

Piping standard output of left command to standard input of the right command

```bash
# pipe from left to right command
cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 | cmd 4

cat [file] | grep [text]  # read file and print lines matching a pattern

# helpers
uniq    # removes any duplicates from the list
uniq -d # show only duplicates
sort    # sorting output of commands

[cmd] | sort | uniq   # show sorted unique lines of cmd output
```


## Redirect (>, >>)
Used to redirect standard output to files. All errors are sent to
standard error.

```bash
[cmd] [operator] [filename]

ls -l /usr/bin > output.txt   # text file is always overwritten
ls -l /usr/bin >> output.txt  # output is appended to text file
ls -l /bin/usr 2> error.txt   # 2> is used to redirect error stream
ls -l /usr/bin &> output.txt  # redirect both outputs to text file
[cmd] 2> /dev/null            # throw away unwanted output
```

## Archiving
Archiving and compressing

```bash
# c - create, x - extract, v - verbose, f - file, - standard IO
tar cvf archive.tar file1 file2 # create archive
tar xvf archive.tar             # unpack tar
gzip [file]                     # compress
gunzip [file]                   # uncompress file.gz
tar z[xvf/cvf] file.tar.gz      # extract tar.gz
```





## chmod
Change permissions of file or folder

```bash
chmod [permissions] [file]
```

| 5       | r - x |
| 6       | r w - |
| 7       | r w x |

```bash
chmod [owner group other] [file]

# Examples
chmod 777 build_script.sh
chmod 755 build_script.sh
chmod 000 build_script.sh
```


### B) Symbolic representation

| User   |Meaning|   | Operators |      |
|:------:|:----:|:--:| :-------: |------|
| u      | user |    |  +        | Add  |
| g      |group |    |  -        | Remove |
| o      |other |    |  =        | Only specified permission should be applied|
| a      | all  |    |           |      |

```bash
chmod [user][operator] [file]

# Examples:
chmod a+x   # Added execution rights to all
chmod g-w   # Remove write permissions from group
chmod u-x   # Remove execute permissions from owner
```

**Use what works for you**


## Scp

Moving files over network

```bash
# local files to remote
scp [file1] [file2]  [username]@[server_ip]:[/path/to/remote/folder]
# remote files to local
scp [username]@[server_ip]:[filename] [/local/folder]
# copying local directory to remote server
scp -r [directory] [username]@[server_ip]:[/path/to/remote/folder]

# if you are transferring large numbers of files often, take a look at rsync
```

# Shell scripts


## Command subsitution

Use bash commands in bash commands

```bash
$(command)

# Example:
echo $(uname -a) # prints system information
echo $((1+5))    # note the double braces around arithmetic expressions

echo `uname -a`  # alternative notation
```


## Brace expansions

Execute the same command
```bash
echo folder_{1, 2, 3}
echo folder_{1..5}
echo folder_{A..Z}
```

## Quotes

### Double quotes `(")`
All special characters lose their meaning, exceptions: `$, \, '`

```bash
echo "$(hostname) computer uptime: $(uptime)"
```

### Single quotes `(')`
Supress all expansions

```bash
echo '$(hostname) computer uptime: $(uptime)'
```




## Simple shell script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello from bash"
python3 hello_world.py
echo "End of script"
```


# Tips & Tricks

1. Subshell

```bash
(cd [path] && [cmd]) # execute this and jump to current working directory
```

2. Bang Bang

```bash
!!      # execute previous command
sudo !! # execute previous command with sudo priviliges
```

3. Quick copy

Share files to another computer on localhost

```bash
# start basic web server on port 8000 from current working directory
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```




# Tasks:


## Task 1
Check syslogs in /var/log/syslog

* whole file
* last 20 lines
* first 5 lines
* dump last 100 lines containing "systemd" into file named systemd.log


## Task 2
Create 2017 txt calendar. Use `cal` command for producing calendar
```bash
cal -y 2017 > calendar.txt
```

## Task 3
Copy all html files from directory1 to directory2, but only those
that do not exist in the destination directory or are newer than the
versions in the destination directory.

```bash
cp -u *.html destination
```
